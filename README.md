# classifying-weather-mashroom-is-edable-or-not

in this data science project i builed a model that can classify weather a given mashroom is edable or not based on certain features.

the algorithem used is Support vector machine which basically builds a hyperplane between the two categories that best separate them .

# output obtained

-linear svm with c =1   has  accuracy of 0.95

-using cross validation to hyperparamer -tune c,gamma values

we get accuracy of  1.0 which is decent output.
